# Plan

1.  **Understand the Request:** The user hasn't provided a specific request yet. I need to wait for their instructions to understand what needs to be done.
2.  **Initial Analysis (Based on context):**
    *   The project appears to be a C#/.NET WPF application (`FluentFlyoutWPF` directory, `.csproj`, `.xaml`, `.cs` files) with an MSIX packaging project (`FluentFlyoutMSIX`).
    *   The active file is `FluentFlyoutMSIX\Package.appxmanifest`, which is an application manifest file for Windows applications.
    *   One of the other open files is `FluentFlyoutWPF\Classes\Utils\TaskSchedulerHelper.cs`, suggesting there might be functionality related to task scheduling.
    *   There are localization files (`Dictionary-*.xaml`), indicating multi-language support.
    *   The `README.md` and other documentation files suggest this is an open-source project.
3.  **Next Step:** Wait for the user's first command or request.
